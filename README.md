# java-cli-sbt-h2-view

## Description
A java sbt build, that connects to h2
database.

Creates a small database table
called `dog`. This table, `dog`, has been normalized to 3NF.
Two new tables have been added, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`.
Creates a new table `dog_expanded` that joins
`dog`, `breedLookup` and `colorLookup`. Added clustered indexes on
`dog`.breedId and `dog`.colorId. Turned `dog_expanded` into a view. All output normally
seen in a terminal will be in `java-srv/log` which will dump to the screen. The project may seem to hang but the logs from the container must be written to the project this can take up to 3 min.

H2 is a database written in `java`
and is best known for a `dev` only
use.
